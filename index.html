            <h1 class="bold">Introduction</h1>
            <p>In a time when climate change, deforestation, and urban expansion threaten the natural balance of our planet, one organization stands tall like the trees it plants—Future Green Network Foundation. Committed to reforesting the earth, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting sustainable living, this foundation envisions a world where communities thrive in harmony with nature.</p>
            <p>Founded on the belief that every tree planted today is an investment in tomorrow, Future Green Network Foundation (FGNF) is more than just a tree-planting group—it's a global movement for ecological restoration, environmental awareness, and community empowerment.</p>

        <div>
            <h1 class="bold">History and Background</h1>
            <p>The seeds of FGNF were planted in 2017, when a small group of environmental scientists and volunteers came together in response to the rapid deforestation in Southeast Asia. Moved by the degradation of once lush landscapes and the adverse effects on local communities, they launched a grassroots campaign with a simple goal: plant 1 million trees in 5 years.</p>
            <p>The idea gained momentum through social media, schools, and civil society. By 2022, the foundation had officially registered as a non-profit organization and expanded its reach to over 20 countries. Today, FGNF works across continents, partnering with governments, corporates, and environmental groups to create greener, healthier ecosystems.</p>

        <div>
            <h1 class="bold">Mission</h1>
            <p>The mission of Future Green Network Foundation is simple yet profound:
                To restore and preserve the planet's green cover through widespread tree planting, community engagement, and sustainable practices.</p>
            <p>This mission is pursued with a deep understanding that tree planting is not just about adding greenery, but about improving air quality, conserving water, restoring wildlife habitats, mitigating climate change, and empowering people through green jobs and education.</p>
        </div>

        <div>

Volunteers, students, farmers, and NGOs participate in annual drives that include seed sowing, transplanting saplings, and nurturing young trees.</p><br></li>
                <li><b>Adopt-a-Tree Program: </b><p class="p2">-A unique fundraising and awareness program where individuals can sponsor trees. Each donor receives a certificate, GPS location of the tree, and annual updates. This fosters a personal connection with the environment.</p><br></li>
                <li><b>School Green Clubs: </b><p class="p2">-FGNF collaborates with educational institutions to establish eco-clubs that educate students on climate change, biodiversity, waste management, and tree plantation. Children are trained to be "Green Ambassadors" of their communities.</p><br></li>
                <li><b>Green Women’s Collective: </b><p class="p2">-Recognizing the power of women in environmental stewardship, this initiative supports women-led nurseries and eco-entrepreneurship. In regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, women are trained to grow saplings and manage reforestation projects.</p><br></li>
                <li><b>Corporate Green Partnerships: </b><p class="p2">-The foundation collaborates with companies to offset their carbon emissions by funding tree plantations.
